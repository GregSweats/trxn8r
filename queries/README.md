# `/queries/`
Power Query Snippets, Formulas, Variables, Scratchpad, etc.

## See Obsidian Vault

> [/obsvault-tiller22/queries/](/obsvault-tiller22/queries/)

Storing the queries in the vault so that we can easily reference Vault pages with easy, quick, `[[Wiki Style]]` links, and all the Obsidian goodness.

Excited to #experiment with this and see what kind of beautiful documentation can be made.

Still editing the queries in vscode, just using that vault directory intead of this one.

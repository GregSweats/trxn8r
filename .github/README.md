> Some of the most used files in .github folder:
>
> - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md -> How to engage in community and how to behave yourself.
> - CONTRIBUTING.md -> How to contribute to repo (making pull request, setting development environment...)
> - LICENSE.md - A software license tells others what they can and can't do with your source code (You should place this at the root of your project since GitHub ignores it in .github folder. You can find this file while browsing other Git hosting services such as GitLab, Bitbucket etc.)
> - FUNDING.yml -> Supporting a project
> - ISSUE_TEMPLATE -> Folder that contains a templates of possible issues user can use to open issue (such as if issue is related to documentation, if it's a bug, if user wants new feature etc) P.S. Take a look at tensorflow ISSUE_TEMPLATE
> - PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md -> How to make a pull request to project
> - stale.yml -> Probot configuration to close stale issues. There are many other apps on Github Marketplace that place their configurations inside .github folder because they are related to GitHub specifically.
> - SECURITY.md -> How to responsibly report a security vulnerability in project
> - workflows -> Configuration folder containing yaml files for GitHub Actions
> - CODEOWNERS -> Pull request reviewer rules. More info here.
> - dependabot.yml -> Configuration options for dependency updates. More info here.

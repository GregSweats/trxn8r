> I’m on the 30-day trial right now. I have used Money in Excel app (MIE) with some nice worksheets provided. I immensely love them.
> 
> It gives me an opportunity to evaluate MIE and its nicer worksheets and Tiller Money Excel with Tiller Foundation template which is fairly new. I find it easier to add manual accounts to MIE than TME.
> 
> I’ve noticed that MIE has retrieved more daily transactions from the bank than TME and MIE balance totals perfectly match my bank balance totals. But both the MIE totals and the TME totals should be the same next day or so.
> 
> $79 a year may be worth it for Google Sheets users, but not for Excel users. When MIE support ends on June 30, 2023, I may look into TME again next year with the improved Foundation template.
> 
> This Tiller community deals with both Google Sheets and Excel Worksheets. I find it very confusing. I have no interest in Google Sheets, period.
> 
> I’m impressed with Tiller Money Support team for answering my questions and others. At the end of the trial, it is my sincere hope that I will return to TME next year to see more attractive EXCEL tables.

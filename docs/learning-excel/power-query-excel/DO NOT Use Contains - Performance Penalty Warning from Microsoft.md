> If you notice that loading a query to a Data Model takes much longer than loading to a worksheet, check your Power Query steps to see if you are filtering a text column or a List structured column by using a **Contains** operator. This action causes Excel to enumerate again through the entire data set for each row. Furthermore, Excel canâ€™t effectively use multithreaded execution. As a workaround, try using a different operator such as **Equals** or **Begins With**.

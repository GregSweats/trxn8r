> In [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering"), **rubber duck debugging** is a method of [debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging "Debugging") code by articulating a problem in spoken or written [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language"). The name is a reference to a story in the book *[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer "The Pragmatic Programmer")* in which a programmer would carry around a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck "Rubber duck") and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging#cite_note-pragprog-1) Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different (usually) inanimate objects, or pets such as a dog or a cat.
> 
> Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging#cite_note-cardboarddog-2) More generally, teaching a subject forces its evaluation from different perspectives and can provide a deeper understanding.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging#cite_note-3) By using an inanimate object, the programmer can try to accomplish this without having to interrupt anyone else. This approach has been taught in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") and software engineering courses.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging#cite_note-5)

## (3) Do you use triple buffering? And why? : PCRedDead
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRedDead/comments/dxk62f/do_you_use_triple_buffering_and_why/

> Triple buffering only applies when you're using VSync. Double buffered VSync will hard lock to 1/2 your refresh rate when you can't maintain a framerate above your refresh rate. This causes a very sudden and noticable drop in fluidity. Triple buffering (or triple buffered VSync, if you prefer) allows intermediate framerates. Meaning, for example, instead of dropping hard from 60 to 30 you only drop to 58. The downside? Triple buffering also adds input lag.

> The [SuperUser](https://wiki.c2.com/?SuperUser) is not to be confused with a [PowerUser](https://wiki.c2.com/?PowerUser), which refers to someone who knows a lot about running their system or systems, and is comfortable exploring further, but doesn't code at all, or enough to be a full-fledged hacker. Also, a [PowerUser](https://wiki.c2.com/?PowerUser) is still a regular user compared to the [SuperUser](https://wiki.c2.com/?SuperUser). [PowerUser](https://wiki.c2.com/?PowerUser)s and regular users have similar privileges, while the [SuperUser](https://wiki.c2.com/?SuperUser) can do anything.

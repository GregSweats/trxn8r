## Posted Feedback with Microsoft Admin Center Thanking, Good Job

>
> Most of my clients are corporate and ue teams.
> 
> I have a few organization I etup < 50 users for with Google Suite, as well as a couple Orgs with MS 365.... 365 is much better!
> 
> Given up on trying to get away from Mcirosoft, since the products since roughly circa 2015+ have really improved. When pandemic hit, the release frequency and quality of MS Teams went up, and the usage went up.
> 
> I am a man who as a kid/teen/wannabe hacker, and open source advocate, referred to Microsoft as M$ and created a high school job replacing Windows NT File Server's (among other weird versions, like 98, ME as a server...ya)... replacing Windows with Linux + Samba.
> 
> Then I learned why big orgs need Active Directory and how I could see the big corporate need trickling down to users.
> 
> Thank you! Good job, Microsoft!

## (3) Crypto Rookie Here: BitBuy or Shakepay? : BitcoinCA

> If you’re new I wouldn’t invest in a cold wallet until you have maybe over $1000 worth of crypto. For hot wallets (regular online wallet), I really like Exodus. It’s easy to learn and has a good UI for beginners. Just keep in mind that transferring Ethereum and ethereum-based tokens costs a lot in transaction fees right now so transfer it once and hold it, try not to move it around too much between wallet and exchanges. Personally, I use a Trezor and it was pretty easy to set up.

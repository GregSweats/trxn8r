> Therefore I do the following steps:
> 
> 1.  I **wrap** my original function **in** a further **let-expression**. Why do I do that? This gets important in step 3, where I want to overwrite the functions metadata. Therefore I need **„access“ to the function itself**. A characteristic feature of let-expression is that after that *in* all variables can be accessed, that are located between the *let* and the *in*. For detailed information about this behaviour, please read the following series of post, regarding the [Environment concept in M](https://ssbi-blog.de/the-environment-concept-in-m-for-power-query-and-power-bi-desktop/).
> 2.  In this step I **put in the metadata**, which I already defined in my **metadata record** *Documentation\_Metadata*. I removed the complete definition from this screenshot, to make it less complex. You will see the complete code at the end of this post.
> 3.  This step **overwrites the metadata** of my custom function *fn* **with the newly defined metadata record** *Documentation\_Metadata*. Let us consider the function from the inside out.
>     -   `Value.Type(fn)`returns *function*, because the type of the custom function *fn* is *function.*
>     -   `Value.ReplaceMetadata()`replaces the input’s metadata information. The input is *function* and I replace the metadata of this type by my record *Documentation\_Metadata.* The result is a *type function* with a new metadata record*.* This is important for the next step.
>     -   `Value.ReplaceType()`takes the function *fn* as first parameter and replaces the old *type function* with the new *type function*, which now has the **metadata record inside**.
> 
> Now that I have completed all the necessary steps, let’s take a look at the final result for this post.

## Excel: Using Dynamic Array Functions (Office 365/Microsoft 365)
URL: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-using-dynamic-array-functions-office-365-microsoft-365

> In September 2018, Microsoft released a new family of functions in Excel called dynamic arrays. With dynamic arrays, a user can write one formula and get many different results. This allows users to build more robust spreadsheets, in less time, with fewer errors. Follow along with Excel MVP Oz du Soleil as he walks you through the new calculation engine and dynamic array functions. He walks through all seven functions—UNIQUE, SORT, SORTBY, SEQUENCE, FILTER, RANDARRAY, and SINGLE—showing practical, real-world uses for each one. Plus, learn how to use the spilled range operator (#) to reference a dynamic spill range. Oz concludes the course with a series of challenges so viewers can practice and master dynamic arrays.

## A Pipeline Story: Code Stream and Cloud PKS | by Tim Davis | Medium
URL: https://vtimd.medium.com/a-pipeline-story-code-stream-and-cloud-pks-5e7b60d2839b

> Let me set the stage for you. I was about 2 or 3 weeks into my new job in VMware Cloud Services. My new boss reached out and said, “Hey, I need you to set up a pipeline from Code Stream into Cloud PKS.” I said that would be no problem! But, there was a problem. I had never used VMware Code Stream or VMWare Cloud PKS before in my life. Great news, they’re both so easy to use that I got this done in 4 days from scratch. Let’s talk about how I got this setup.
> 
> First and foremost, let’s talk about these two products, starting with VMware Cloud PKS. Cloud PKS is an enterprise-grade Kubernetes-as-a-Service offering in the VMware Cloud Services portfolio that provides easy to use, secure, cost-effective, and fully managed Kubernetes clusters. Cloud PKSenables users to run containerized applications without the cost and complexity of implementing and operating Kubernetes. For more information about this service and to request access, please visit [http://cloud.vmware.com/vmware-kubernetes-engine](http://cloud.vmware.com/vmware-kubernetes-engine). The second piece of this is Code Stream. This is part of VMware Cloud Automation Services. It offers full CI/CD as a Service. For more information about this service and to request access, please visit [https://cloud.vmware.com/code-stream](https://cloud.vmware.com/code-stream).
> 
> So, to make this work, I needed a simple application for Kubernetes. I found this in the Kubernetes sample applications on GitHub. I cloned the repo to [here](https://github.com/vtimd/cs-pipeline-vke). I will be using the YAML files in the Guestbook app. The process is pretty simple. When code is committed and pushed from VS Code, or any editor, to Github, it will trigger the pipeline.

Excerpt:

> Emails sent between Proton Mail users are automatically [end-to-end encrypted](https://proton.me/blog/what-is-end-to-end-encryption) (E2EE). You can send a message that is automatically end-to-end encrypted to someone who doesn’t use Proton Mail if they use [PGP](https://proton.me/support/how-to-use-pgp).
> 
> In addition to this, we offer a **Password-protected Emails** feature that allows you to send E2EE messages to any email user without the need for PGP. 
> 
> With Password-protected Emails, your recipient receives an email telling them they have been sent a secure encrypted message. To read the message, they must enter a previously agreed-upon password. This takes them to a secure Proton Mail mailbox where they can read your message and respond using E2EE. You do not need a Proton Mail account to access this inbox.

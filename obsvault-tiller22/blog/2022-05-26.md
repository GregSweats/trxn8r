> ### riginally we set out to build an app
> 
> But after much research and many interviews, we discovered that people with the greatest financial peace of mind all had something in common.
> 
> It wasn’t wealth, low debt, or even a high income. **It was simply that financially confident people were highly engaged with their money.** And spreadsheets were the tool they preferred for the job.
> 
> Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised. After all, spreadsheets are simple, familiar, and private. And no other financial tool is as customizable.

## How to Write Non-U.S. Dollars as Words and Symbols
URL: https://erinwrightwriting.com/write-non-u-s-dollars-words-symbols/

> ### Use Abbreviations with the Dollar Sign
> 
> Chicago style recommends using a country abbreviation before the dollar symbol for more frequent references to non-U.S. dollars.3
> 
> In Sydney, a dozen eggs costs **A$6**.
> 
> One bag of apples costs **HK$30**.
> 
> Unlike AP style, Chicago style doesn’t provide a specific list of country abbreviations, so ensure that the abbreviations you choose are clear based on the surrounding content.
> 
> ### Use Currency Codes
> 
> In formal documents, Chicago style says that you can use the [International Organization for Standardization’s](https://www.iso.org/home.html) letter codes for all currency, including non-U.S. dollars.4
> 
> In Sydney, a dozen eggs costs **AUD6**.
> 
> One bag of apples costs **HKD30**.
> 
> However, determine your audience’s familiarity with these codes before using them because they may not be as widely recognized as the abbreviation–symbol method shown above.

## What is Tilt Tension on an Office Chair & What is it For? - Lakeland Furniture Blog

> ## What is the tilt tension feature on an office chair?
> 
> Often, people buy office chairs without truly understanding how they work. Office chairs come in all shapes and sizes - with many, unique features that can have great benefits to anyone who uses them! It can really pay to understand how certain features of an office chair can work. For example, a lumbar support is crucial to those who have back problems and can also prevent these issues in the first place. So today, we're going to be focusing on the tension tilt feature. What is it? How does it work? And why is it important? Keep reading to find out! Firstly, let's look at the definition of a 'tension tilt'. The 'tilt' part is what enables you to rock back and forth on your chair, and also recline. Where does the tension come in, you ask? Well, the 'tension' feature is a knob which can be adjusted to increase or decrease the force needed to tilt. So, a tension tilt feature essentially allows you to decide how much you want to recline on a chair, and how much force is needed to do so.

> At its core, BBT behaves like any Zotero import/export module; anywhere you can export or import bibliography items in Zotero, you’ll find *Better X* listed among the choices.

> If nothing else, you could keep your existing workflow as-is, and just enjoy the improved LaTeX ↔ unicode translation on import and export and more accurate field mapping.

> Better BibTeX works from [BibTeXing](http://ctan.cs.uu.nl/biblio/bibtex/base/btxdoc.pdf) and [Tame the BeaST](http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~markey/BibTeX/doc/ttb_en.pdf) for BibTeX, and [The Biblatex Package](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf) for BibLaTeX, but since there isn’t really a definitive manual for either format that is universally followed by Bib(La)TeX editors/processors, I’m pragmatic about implementing what works.

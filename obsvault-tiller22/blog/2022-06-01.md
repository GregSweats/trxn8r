## "Git - The Protocols"
#WebClip  #TodayILearned
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols
2022-06-01 09:10:25




Excerpt:

> ### The Git Protocol
> 
> Finally, we have the Git protocol. This is a special daemon that comes packaged with Git; it listens on a dedicated port (9418) that provides a service similar to the SSH protocol, but with absolutely no authentication. In order for a repository to be served over the Git protocol, you must create a `git-daemon-export-ok` file — the daemon won’t serve a repository without that file in it — but, other than that, there is no security. Either the Git repository is available for everyone to clone, or it isn’t. This means that there is generally no pushing over this protocol. You can enable push access but, given the lack of authentication, anyone on the internet who finds your project’s URL could push to that project. Suffice it to say that this is rare.
> 
> #### The Pros
> 
> The Git protocol is often the fastest network transfer protocol available. If you’re serving a lot of traffic for a public project or serving a very large project that doesn’t require user authentication for read access, it’s likely that you’ll want to set up a Git daemon to serve your project. It uses the same data-transfer mechanism as the SSH protocol but without the encryption and authentication overhead.
> 
> #### The Cons
> 
> The downside of the Git protocol is the lack of authentication. It’s generally undesirable for the Git protocol to be the only access to your project. Generally, you’ll pair it with SSH or HTTPS access for the few developers who have push (write) access and have everyone else use `git://` for read-only access. It’s also probably the most difficult protocol to set up. It must run its own daemon, which requires `xinetd` or `systemd` configuration or the like, which isn’t always a walk in the park. It also requires firewall access to port 9418, which isn’t a standard port that corporate firewalls always allow. Behind big corporate firewalls, this obscure port is commonly blocked.

Excerpt:

> I’ve been playing with the Excel version of Tiller Money, hoping to learn how to convert my various templates to work in Excel. There are some painfully different behaviors between Excel and Google Sheets! One of my first attempts is to get the “Group” column working in the Transactions sheet. In Google Sheets, it’s easy to setup an ArrayFormua to look at the transactions “Category”, and then go find which group that’s in on the Categories sheet, and list it in the Group column. Not so in Excel. I thought I had it licked when I came up with this formula:  
> `=IFNA(INDEX(Categories[Group],MATCH([@Category],Categories[Category],0)),"")`
> 
> Worked perfectly, listing the correct group for each transaction, until I imported new transactions. The formula, which I had placed in row 2, got bumped down the list as new transactions were inserted above it. I then thought, OK, I’ll put this formula in row 1 so it stays there, and either shows the column header, or the formula depending on the row:  
> `=IF(ROW()=1,"Group",IFNA(INDEX(Categories[Group],MATCH([@Category],Categories[Category],0)),""))`
> 
> No such luck. You can’t have a formula in a header row unless you tell Excel it’s not a header row, in which case it will sort itself to the bottom of the list at the first opportunity.
> 
> Anyone know how to make this work?

Excerpt:

> These problems sound familiar and I don’t have ready answers for you. From a design perspective, we are committing to making the `Categories`, `Transactions` & `Balance History` sheets into tables so that the data is readily accessible— no more of those weird header lookups we use extensively in Sheets.

Excerpt:

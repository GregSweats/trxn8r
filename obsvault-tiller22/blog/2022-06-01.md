## "Git - The Protocols"
#WebClip  #TodayILearned
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols
2022-06-01 09:10:25




Excerpt:

> ### The Git Protocol
> 
> Finally, we have the Git protocol. This is a special daemon that comes packaged with Git; it listens on a dedicated port (9418) that provides a service similar to the SSH protocol, but with absolutely no authentication. In order for a repository to be served over the Git protocol, you must create a `git-daemon-export-ok` file — the daemon won’t serve a repository without that file in it — but, other than that, there is no security. Either the Git repository is available for everyone to clone, or it isn’t. This means that there is generally no pushing over this protocol. You can enable push access but, given the lack of authentication, anyone on the internet who finds your project’s URL could push to that project. Suffice it to say that this is rare.
> 
> #### The Pros
> 
> The Git protocol is often the fastest network transfer protocol available. If you’re serving a lot of traffic for a public project or serving a very large project that doesn’t require user authentication for read access, it’s likely that you’ll want to set up a Git daemon to serve your project. It uses the same data-transfer mechanism as the SSH protocol but without the encryption and authentication overhead.
> 
> #### The Cons
> 
> The downside of the Git protocol is the lack of authentication. It’s generally undesirable for the Git protocol to be the only access to your project. Generally, you’ll pair it with SSH or HTTPS access for the few developers who have push (write) access and have everyone else use `git://` for read-only access. It’s also probably the most difficult protocol to set up. It must run its own daemon, which requires `xinetd` or `systemd` configuration or the like, which isn’t always a walk in the park. It also requires firewall access to port 9418, which isn’t a standard port that corporate firewalls always allow. Behind big corporate firewalls, this obscure port is commonly blocked.

2022-06-01 12:08:34



Excerpt:

> I’ve been playing with the Excel version of Tiller Money, hoping to learn how to convert my various templates to work in Excel. There are some painfully different behaviors between Excel and Google Sheets! One of my first attempts is to get the “Group” column working in the Transactions sheet. In Google Sheets, it’s easy to setup an ArrayFormua to look at the transactions “Category”, and then go find which group that’s in on the Categories sheet, and list it in the Group column. Not so in Excel. I thought I had it licked when I came up with this formula:  
> `=IFNA(INDEX(Categories[Group],MATCH([@Category],Categories[Category],0)),"")`
> 
> Worked perfectly, listing the correct group for each transaction, until I imported new transactions. The formula, which I had placed in row 2, got bumped down the list as new transactions were inserted above it. I then thought, OK, I’ll put this formula in row 1 so it stays there, and either shows the column header, or the formula depending on the row:  
> `=IF(ROW()=1,"Group",IFNA(INDEX(Categories[Group],MATCH([@Category],Categories[Category],0)),""))`
> 
> No such luck. You can’t have a formula in a header row unless you tell Excel it’s not a header row, in which case it will sort itself to the bottom of the list at the first opportunity.
> 
> Anyone know how to make this work?

Excerpt:

> These problems sound familiar and I don’t have ready answers for you. From a design perspective, we are committing to making the `Categories`, `Transactions` & `Balance History` sheets into tables so that the data is readily accessible— no more of those weird header lookups we use extensively in Sheets.

## "Use Callouts in Markdown Editor · Issue #469 · BookStackApp/BookStack"
#WebClip 
https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/469
2022-06-01 12:53:39



Excerpt:

> Since callouts are not a standard part of markdown there's no special syntax for them but you can add HTML into the markdown editor. Therefore you can add the HTML for callouts within the markdown editor without any issue. Here's an example with all callout types:
> 
> ```
> # My Markdown Page
> 
> <p class="callout info">A success message</p>
> <p class="callout success">A success message</p>
> <p class="callout warning">A success message</p>
> <p class="callout danger">A success message</p>
> 
> Normal markdown text
> ```
> 
> In the last bugfix release, v0.17.4, I actually expanded the shortcuts for the markdown editor quite a lot including a callout shortcut `Ctrl+9` (Or `Cmd+9` on mac) which would insert the info callout syntax for you but in writing out this message I realised this is currently a little broken ([#470](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/470)).

Excerpt:

> ## Welcome!
> 
> ## Together with TimeLog you get several possibilities of accessing your data via APIs. This website will introduce each of them and let you know how to get started.
> 
> TimeLog A/S provides programmatic access to your organization’s TimeLog (TLP) site through a simple and secure API (application programming interface). The API is programmed with the target of integration and development of extensions of TLP with external add-ons. It focuses on providing access to the core objects of TLP. This website will explain how to access and use the API and what data you can access, insert and modify through the current versions. To use this API, you should have a basic familiarity with software development, web services, and the TLP user interface.
> 
> ## [3 Flavors of Access](https://api.timelog.com/#3-flavors-of-access)
> 
> Due to varying requirements of working with your data, TimeLog currently have three difference API interfaces:
> 
> -   **REST API** - Use for employee-centered actions. Reading and writing data is available for selected data types. Employee-specific-token only. [Read more](https://api.timelog.com/rest)
> -   **Transactional API** - Use the transactional API for transferring data to and from TimeLog to keep other systems in sync or automatically push updates to TimeLog. Reading and writing data is available for selected data types. Server-to-server employee user only. [Read more](https://api.timelog.com/transactional)
> -   **Reporting API** - Use the reporting API to fetch big data sets from TimeLog. Only read-access is available. Server-to-server service user only. [Read more](https://api.timelog.com/reporting)

## Is there an overview of what can go into a .github "dot github" directory? - Stack Overflow
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60507097/is-there-an-overview-of-what-can-go-into-a-github-dot-github-directory

> On Github, folder `.github` is just a convention folder used to place Github related stuff inside it. Github handles some of these files even when you place it in root of your project (*such as `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` etc*). Because Github is constantly bringing in new features, these features are documented on their own, so there is no *"all possible files in .github"* page. Feel free to place anything that is related to **Github** specifically inside it.
> 
> Some of the most used files in `.github` folder:
> 
> -   `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` -> How to engage in community and how to behave yourself.
> -   `CONTRIBUTING.md` -> How to contribute to repo (*making pull request, setting development environment...*)
> -   `LICENSE.md` - A software license tells others what they can and can't do with your source code (*You should place this at the root of your project since GitHub ignores it in `.github` folder. You can find this file while browsing other Git hosting services such as GitLab, Bitbucket etc.*)
> -   `FUNDING.yml` -> Supporting a project
> -   `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` -> Folder that contains a templates of possible issues user can use to open issue (*such as if issue is related to documentation, if it's a bug, if user wants new feature etc*) P.S. Take a look at tensorflow [ISSUE\_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/f3fd82f65724cdba600fdd23d251c2b01152ed3c/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)
> -   `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` -> How to make a pull request to project
> -   `stale.yml` -> Probot configuration to close stale issues. There are many other apps on Github Marketplace that place their configurations inside `.github` folder because they are related to GitHub specifically.
> -   `SECURITY.md` -> How to responsibly report a security vulnerability in project
> -   `workflows` -> Configuration folder containing yaml files for GitHub Actions
> -   `CODEOWNERS` -> Pull request reviewer rules. More info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners).
> -   `dependabot.yml` -> Configuration options for dependency updates. More info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates).

> 
> A **state diagram** is a type of [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram "Diagram") used in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") and related fields to describe the behavior of systems. State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science) "State (computer science)"); sometimes, this is indeed the case, while at other times this is a reasonable [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science) "Abstraction (computer science)"). Many forms of state diagrams exist, which differ slightly and have different [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics#Computer_science "Semantics").

> ## Static site generators
> 
> GitHub Pages publishes any static files that you push to your repository. You can create your own static files or use a static site generator to build your site for you. You can also customize your own build process locally or on another server. We recommend Jekyll, a static site generator with built-in support for GitHub Pages and a simplified build process. For more information, see "[About GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)."
> 
> GitHub Pages will use Jekyll to build your site by default. If you want to use a static site generator other than Jekyll, disable the Jekyll build process by creating an empty file called `.nojekyll` in the root of your publishing source, then follow your static site generator's instructions to build your site locally.
> 
> GitHub Pages does not support server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, or Python.

> **The MIT License.** The main argument for MIT or any other permissive license over GPL is that more people may end up using your software. Even if all of the downstream user-developers don’t open-source their contributions, many of them will. There are non-legal reasons for others to contribute, the main one being that if they don’t, they either have to fork (foregoing improvements on the trunk) or maintain a closed-source branch and keep integrating changes from the open-source mainline.
> 
> The MIT license is sort of like a loss-leader in a way: “Hey, it’s free, no legal restrictions, why not try it out?”. So they do. Then, later, they realize they want to be part of the open source collaboration, to get features and bugfixes and avoid messy merges.
> 
> You have to be ok with someone else taking your MIT-licensed software building another commercial closed-source application (or plugins or add-ons) based on it. For example, Mac OSX [used many parts of BSD](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3446231/how-closely-are-mac-os-x-and-bsd-related). BSD is under an MIT-like license. Apple could not have done that with Linux (not without open-sourcing OSX anyway), because Linux is GPL licensed. On the other hand, Apple has contributed things [back to FreeBSD](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Myths)because of the resultant similarity.
> 
> **The Apache License.** The Apache license has a similar philosophy to the MIT, but uses more words. The wordiness creates greater specificity about contributors’ obligations, which might help in a dispute.  But it also can be a turnoff — “Do I need to have my lawyer look at this?” comes up more with Apache than MIT. It works well for organizations or projects that are larger and managing more contributors, but don’t care about others commercializing the work. It also can help bring on board organizations that are more concerned about software patents or patent trolls.
> 
> **The GPL Licenses.** The GPL has name recognition. Developers like it out of a sense of fairness (“I open sourced my code so you should too”). Some of the most-installed open source software is GPL-licensed, such as Linux, WordPress, and Wikipedia’s underlying software, MediaWiki. Wikipedia’s content is (mostly) under the Creative Commons BY-SA license, which has similar share-alike features to the GPL. For individual contributors who want assurances of openness and transparency, and to avoid a BSD-into-OSX situation, the GPL provides assurance that other contributors will be held to the same licensing terms. While the GPL can be a turnoff for some corporations, it can create community among individuals.
> 
> The GPL sharing provisions involve nuance and ambiguity.  Companies adopting GPL software have to ask “are we going to end up having to release our other software that integrates with this under the GPL?” Just getting through the hurdle of doing that legal-technical analysis can bog down adoption of the GPL’d software; and even when a company does a thoughtful analysis, the end result is sometimes “yeah, we’d rather not risk it”. Some companies have blanket policies against the GPL, either out of misunderstanding, an abundance of caution, a desire to not engage in complex legal-technical analyses, or a combination of all of the above. I’ve also seen startups  avoid incorporating GPL software in their products because potential acquirers avoid it. If you are releasing software under a GPL license, it is also necessary to determine what the sharing criteria are, which vary between the different GPL licenses and can affect when downstream users have to release their source code.

Excerpt:

> -   **Use valid characters**  Always start a name with a letter, an underscore character (**\_**), or a backslash (**\\**). Use letters, numbers, periods, and underscore characters for the rest of the name. You can’t use "C", "c", "R", or "r" for the name, because they’re already designated as a shortcut for selecting the column or row for the active cell when you enter them in the **Name** or **Go To** box.

Excerpt:

> ## Structured reference syntax rules
> 
> You can also enter or change structured references manually in the formula but to do that, it will help to understand structured reference syntax. Let’s go over the following formula example:
> 
> \=SUM(DeptSales\[\[#Totals\],\[Sales Amount\]\],DeptSales\[\[#Data\],\[Commission Amount\]\])
> 
> This formula has the following structured reference components:
> 
> -   **Table name:**    **DeptSales** is a custom table name. It references the table data, without any header or total rows. You can use a default table name, such as Table1, or change it to use a custom name.
>     
> -   **Column specifier:**    **\[Sales Amount\]** **and** **\[Commission Amount**\] are column specifiers that use the names of the columns they represent. They reference the column data, without any column header or total row. Always enclose specifiers in brackets as shown.
>     
> -   **Item specifier:**    **\[#Totals\]** and **\[#Data\]** are special item specifiers that refer to specific portions of the table, such as the total row.
>     
> -   **Table specifier:**    **\[\[#Totals\],\[Sales Amount\]\]** and **\[\[#Data\],\[Commission Amount\]\]** are table specifiers that represent the outer portions of the structured reference. Outer references follow the table name, and you enclose them in square brackets.
>     
> -   **Structured reference:**    **(DeptSales\[\[#Totals\],\[Sales Amount\]\]** and **DeptSales\[\[#Data\],\[Commission Amount\]\]** are structured references, represented by a string that begins with the table name and ends with the column specifier.
>     
> 
> To create or edit structured references manually, use these syntax rules:
> 
> -   **Use brackets around specifiers**    All table, column, and special item specifiers need to be enclosed in matching brackets (\[ \]). A specifier that contains other specifiers requires outer matching brackets to enclose the inner matching brackets of the other specifiers. For example: **\=DeptSales\[\[Sales Person\]:\[Region\]\]**
>     
> -   **All column headers are text strings**    But they don’t require quotes when they’re used in a structured reference. Numbers or dates, such as 2014 or 1/1/2014, are also considered text strings. You can’t use expressions with column headers. For example, the expression **DeptSalesFYSummary\[\[2014\]:\[2012\]\]** won’t work.
>     
> 
> **Use brackets around column headers with special characters**    If there are special characters, the entire column header needs to be enclosed in brackets, which means that double brackets are required in a column specifier. For example: **\=DeptSalesFYSummary\[\[Total $ Amount\]\]**
> 
> Here’s the list of special characters that need extra brackets in the formula:
> 
> -   Tab
>     
> -   Line feed
>     
> -   Carriage return
>     
> -   Comma (,)
>     
> -   Colon (:)
>     
> -   Period (.)
>     
> -   Left bracket (\[)
>     
> -   Right bracket (\])
>     
> -   Pound sign (#)
>     
> -   Single quotation mark (')
>     
> -   Double quotation mark (")
>     
> -   Left brace ({)
>     
> -   Right brace (})
>     
> -   Dollar sign ($)
>     
> -   Caret (^)
>     
> -   Ampersand (&)
>     
> -   Asterisk (\*)
>     
> -   Plus sign (+)
>     
> -   Equal sign (=)
>     
> -   Minus sign (-)
>     
> -   Greater than symbol (>)
>     
> -   Less than symbol (<)
>     
> -   Division sign (/)
>     
> 
> -   **Use an escape character for some special characters in column headers**    Some characters have special meaning and require the use of a single quotation mark (') as an escape character. For example: **\=DeptSalesFYSummary\['#OfItems\]**
>     
> 
> **Here’s the list of special characters that need an escape character (‘) in the formula:**
> 
> -   Left bracket (\[)
>     
> -   Right bracket (\])
>     
> -   Pound sign(#)
>     
> -   Single quotation mark (')
>     
> 
> **Use the space character to improve readability in a structured reference**    You can use space characters to improve the readability of a structured reference. For example: **\=DeptSales\[ \[Sales Person\]:\[Region\] \]** or **\=DeptSales\[\[#Headers\], \[#Data\], \[% Commission\]\]**
> 
> It’s recommended to use one space:
> 
> -   After the first left bracket (\[)
>     
> -   Preceding the last right bracket (\]).
>     
> -   After a comma.
>     
> 
> ## Reference operators
> 
> For more flexibility in specifying ranges of cells, you can use the following reference operators to combine column specifiers.

Excerpt:

> Consider the following when you work with structured references.
> 
> -   **Use Formula AutoComplete**    You may find that using Formula AutoComplete is very useful when you enter structured references and to ensure the use of correct syntax. For more information, see [Use Formula AutoComplete](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-formula-autocomplete-6d13daa5-e003-4431-abab-9edef51fae6b).
>     
> -   **Decide whether to generate structured references for tables in semi-selections**    By default, when you create a formula, clicking a cell range within a table semi-selects the cells and automatically enters a structured reference instead of the cell range in the formula. This semi-selection behavior makes it much easier to enter a structured reference. You can turn this behavior on or off by selecting or clearing the **Use table names in formulas** check box in the **File** > **Options** > **Formulas** > **Working with formulas** dialog.
>     
> -   **Use workbooks with external links to Excel tables in other workbooks**    If a workbook contains an external link to an Excel table in another workbook, that linked source workbook must be open in Excel to avoid [#REF!](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-correct-a-ref-error-822c8e46-e610-4d02-bf29-ec4b8c5ff4be) errors in the destination workbook that contains the links. If you open the destination workbook first and [#REF!](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-correct-a-ref-error-822c8e46-e610-4d02-bf29-ec4b8c5ff4be) errors appear, they will be resolved if you then open the source workbook. If you open the source workbook first, you should see no error codes.
>     
> -   **Convert a range to a table and a table to a range**    When you convert a table to a range, all cell references change to their equivalent absolute A1 style references. When you convert a range to a table, Excel doesn’t automatically change any cell references of this range to their equivalent structured references.
>     
> -   **Turn off column headers**    You can toggle table column headers on and off from the table **Design** tab > **Header Row**. If you turn off table column headers, structured references that use column names aren’t affected, and you can still use them in formulas. Structured references that refer directly to the table headers (e.g. **\=DeptSales\[\[#Headers\],\[%Commission\]\]**) will result in [#REF](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-correct-a-ref-error-822c8e46-e610-4d02-bf29-ec4b8c5ff4be).
>     
> -   **Add or delete columns and rows to the table**    Because table data ranges often change, cell references for structured references adjust automatically. For example, if you use a table name in a formula to count all the data cells in a table, and you then add a row of data, the cell reference automatically adjusts.
>     
> -   **Rename a table or column**    If you rename a column or table, Excel automatically changes the use of that table and column header in all structured references that are used in the workbook.
>     
> -   **Move, copy, and fill structured references**    All structured references remain the same when you copy or move a formula that uses a structured reference.

> ###   
> Naming Conventions
> 
> *Naming conventions* are words, phrases, or abbreviations that are made standard to stand in as a name for something. Naming conventions and their individual standards depend upon who develops, maintains, and uses them. This is because each and every agency and client have different needs. 
> 
> ####   
> Development
> 
> When developing your own internal naming conventions, consider the following:
> 
> -   **Be sure to document everything.** Even if the conventions change over time, having a master list of conventions and standards allow you to refer to them at a moment's notice. Keeping this documentation updated is also important, as new conventions may be necessary. 
> -   **Naming conventions must be easy to understand for you, your users, and your audience.** If the naming convention is overly technical, a confusing term, or randomly associated with what it is supposed to represent, it will be more trouble than it is worth. Keeping things simple is best.
> -   **Naming conventions should be as short as possible, while also being as specific as possible.** There may be times when a long term is necessary, but, in general, keep naming conventions to a short phrase or abbreviation. The conventions should also directly reference what it is that they represent.
> -   **Naming conventions are only successful if used consistently.** The naming convention is useless if it is either never used or used with multiple variations. It is important to keep to one naming convention for a term and to keep using it.
> -   **Naming conventions must also be able to handle special cases where exceptions to the rule must be made.** There may be times when a naming convention needs to have new items attached to it or otherwise may need to apply to other content. The naming convention must be flexible enough to accommodate variations, such as *FB-P* and *FB-M* for Facebook posts and messages. These should be few and far between, however, to keep confusion and clutter to a minimum.
> -   **Naming conventions should be searchable and sortable.** Naming conventions are what will appear when searching metadata and moving files. Having them appear as results when searching helps to find specific content.

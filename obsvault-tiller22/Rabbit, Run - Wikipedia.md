> In *Rabbit, Run*, I liked writing in the present tense. You can move between minds, between thoughts and objects and events with a curious ease not available to the past tense. I don't know if it is clear to the reader as it is to the person writing, but there are kinds of poetry, kinds of music you can strike off in the present tense.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit,_Run#cite_note-19)
